5</span>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>The tale of <i>Emelian</i>, of which we give here a version,
is highly popular amongst the peasantry of Russia, and is told by
them at their merry-makings from the upper shores of the Gulf of
Finland to the Ural Mountains.&nbsp; It bears some resemblance to
the tale of <i>Aladdin</i>, the pike playing in the Russian story
much the same part as the lamp in the Arabian one, and it is by
no means impossible that both tales are derived from the same
myth.&nbsp; But from whatever source the story of <i>Emelian</i>
may have sprung, the manner in which it is wrought is essentially
Russian, and from it, as here rendered, the English reader may
form a better idea of the <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>way of life, and the feelings of the
Russian mujiks, or peasantry, than from a dozen common books of
travels in Russia.&nbsp; Emelian is represented as a fool, but
there is much in what he says and does common to the Russian
mujik in general.&nbsp; He lies in the izbushka, or cabin, upon
the petsch, or stove, and when told to get up, he says:
&ldquo;What should I get up for?&mdash;Mnie zdies teplo, i ia
lieni&oacute;s&mdash;&rsquo;tis warm here, and I am
lazy.&rdquo;&nbsp; There spoke the genuine mujik, the most
prominent features of whose character are a love of warmth and a
hatred of exertion, though, when he chooses to get up and rouse
himself, he is capable of very great things, can outwit the
tchort himself, bear hunger and fatigue better than any other
man, and contend even with the Briton at the game of the
bayonet.&nbsp; Perhaps we may hereafter present to the public in
an English dress some other popular tales illustrative of the
manner of life and ideas of the mujiks, to whom <!-- page 7--><a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>the attention
of the English public has of late been much directed, owing to
the ukase of the present Tsar, by which they are emancipated from
serfdom,&mdash;a measure likely to be productive of much weal or
woe throughout his extensive dominions.</p>
<p>The tale is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<h2>EMELIAN THE FOOL</h2>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>In a certain village there lived a mujik, or yeoman, who
had three sons; two were clever, but the third was a fool, who
was called Emelian.&nbsp; When the good man had reached an
extreme old age, he called all his sons to him, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear children, I feel that I have not long to live; I
therefore leave you house and cattle, which you will divide in
equal portions.&nbsp; I also leave you money: a hundred roubles
for each.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon after these words he died, and his children, having given
him a decent funeral, lived very comfortably.&nbsp; After a
little time, the brothers of Emelian took it into their heads to
start for the city, and employ in traffic the three <!-- page
9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>hundred
roubles which their father had left them; so they said to the
fool Emelian:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harkee, fool, we are going to the city, and will take
your hundred roubles with us, and if our traffic goes on
profitably we will buy you a red caftan, a red cap, and red
boots; but do you remain at home, and if your sisters-in-law, our
wives (for they were married) order you to do anything, be sure
you do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fool, wishing to receive the red caftan, red cap, and red
boots, told his brothers in reply that he would do whatever his
sisters-in-law should order him.&nbsp; After this, his brothers
set out for the city, and the fool remained at home, and lived
with his sisters-in-law.&nbsp; After some time, on a certain day,
when it was winter, and there was a terrible frost, his
sisters-in-law told him to go for water; but the fool, who was
lying on the petsch, or stove, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, and why not you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>&ldquo;Why not we, you fool?&rdquo; cried the
sisters-in-law; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you see what a frost it is?
and that none but a man can go out in such weather?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am lazy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lazy?&rdquo; screamed his sisters-in-law;
&ldquo;won&rsquo;t you presently want something to eat?&nbsp; And
if there be no water how can we boil anything?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Thereupon they added, &ldquo;Very well, when our husbands come
home with the red caftan and cap they promised him, we will tell
them to give him nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the fool heard this he thought it best to go, for he
wished very much to get the red caftan and cap.&nbsp; So getting
down from the petsch he began to put on his stockings and boots,
and to dress himself; and when he was quite dressed, he took with
him a couple of pails and a hatchet, and went to the river: for
the village in which they lived stood very near the river.&nbsp;
When he had come to the stream, he began to hew away <!-- page
11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>at
the ice, and when he had made a very big hole, he filled his
pails with water, and placing them on the ice, he stood beside
the hole, and looked.&nbsp; Now as the fool stood and looked he
saw a very large pike swimming in the hole.&nbsp; Fool as Emelian
was, he nevertheless wished to catch the pike.&nbsp; He therefore
advanced softly, and coming near to it, seized it suddenly with
his hand, and pulling it out of the water, placed it in his
bosom, and began to make for home.&nbsp; But the pike said to
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s this, fool? for what do you seize
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what?&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I shall carry you
home, and tell my sisters-in-law to boil you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so, fool, don&rsquo;t carry me home, but put me
back into the water, and I will make you a rich man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the fool did not believe him, and was making for
home.&nbsp; The pike, seeing that the fool did not let him go,
said:</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>&ldquo;Listen, fool, do but put me into the water, and I
will do for you whatsoever you wish, so that every desire of your
heart shall be fulfilled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fool, hearing these words, was very glad; for, as he was
excessively lazy, he thought to himself&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the pike does whatever I ask all will be got ready
for me, and I shall have no need to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He therefore said to the pike:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will let you go, only do what you promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the pike made answer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;First place me in the water, and I will fulfil my
promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the fool said to him that he must first of all perform his
promise, and that he would then let him go.</p>
<p>The pike, seeing that he would not put him into the water,
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wish me to do for you what you want, <!-- page
13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>you
must now tell me what it is that you desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fool said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I desire that my pails of water should march of
themselves up the hill&rdquo; (for the village stood upon a
hill), &ldquo;but so that none of the water be spilt out of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pike immediately said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, Emelian, the words which I am about to say to
you, and the words are as follows: &lsquo;At the pike&rsquo;s
behest, and at my request, march, pails, by yourselves up the
hill.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fool repeated the words after the pike:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the pike&rsquo;s behest, and at my request march,
pails, by yourselves up the hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forthwith the pails, and the yoke by which he was wont to
carry them, marched of themselves up the hill.&nbsp; Emelian,
seeing this, was very much surprised, and said to the pike:</p>
<p><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>&ldquo;Will it always be so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which the pike made answer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All things you wish will be done, even as this has been
done: only don&rsquo;t forget the words which I have taught
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon he released the pike into the water, and went
himself after his pails.&nbsp; The neighbours, seeing what was
going on, were filled with wonder, and said, amongst,
themselves&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the fool about?&nbsp; The pails of water walk
of themselves, and he walks after them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Emelian, without saying anything to them, went home, and
the pails went of themselves into the keeping-room, and placed
themselves on the bench, while the fool mounted upon the
petsch.&nbsp; A little time after, his sisters-in-law said to him
again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emelian, what do you lie there for? go and cut some
wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>But the fool said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, and why not you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We?&rdquo; screamed his sisters-in-law; &ldquo;it is
now winter, and if you do not go and cut some wood you will soon
be cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am lazy,&rdquo; said the fool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lazy?&rdquo; said his sisters-in-law to him,
&ldquo;then you will be frozen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon they added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t go and cut wood we will tell our
husbands not to give you the red caftan, nor the red cap, nor the
boots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fool, from the desire which he felt to obtain the red
caftan, cap, and boots, was obliged to comply with their
request.&nbsp; But as he was thoroughly lazy, and did not wish to
get down from the petsch, he said these words softly as he
lay:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the pike&rsquo;s behest, and at my request, go,
hatchet, now, and cut down wood; and do you, <!-- page 16--><a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>wood, come of
yourself to the room, and stow yourself within the
stove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forthwith, the hatchet, without anyone taking it, hopped
forth, and began to cut away, and the wood of itself came into
the room, and stowed itself in the stove, at the sight of which
the sisters-in-law wondered much at the craft of Emelian; and
every day, when the fool only ordered the hatchet to go out and
cut wood, the hatchet went and cut some.&nbsp; And in this manner
he lived with his sisters-in-law for some time.&nbsp; At length,
his sisters-in-law said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emelian! we have no wood, so pray go out into the
forest and cut some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fool said: &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go
yourselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should we go?&rdquo; replied his sisters-in-law;
&ldquo;the forest is a great way off, and as it is now winter, it
is too cold for us to go to the forest for wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>But the fool said to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am lazy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lazy!&rdquo; cried his sisters-in-law; &ldquo;if you
don&rsquo;t go you will soon be cold.&nbsp; But if you refuse to
go, when your brothers, our husbands, come home we will order
them to give you neither red caftan, red cap, nor red
boots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fool, wishing to obtain the red caftan, cap and boots,
felt obliged to go to the forest for wood, and getting up from
the petsch, he began to put on his stockings and boots, and to
dress himself; and when he was quite dressed he went out into the
court, and drawing the sledge out of the shed, and taking with
him a rope and hatchet, he mounted the sledge, and bade his
sisters-in-law open the gate.&nbsp; The sisters-in-law, seeing
that he got into the sledge without putting the horses to it, for
the fool did not lead out the horses, said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is this, Emelian? you have got into <!-- page
18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>the
sledge without putting the horses to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he said to them that he had no need of horses, and only
wanted them to open the gate.&nbsp; The sisters-in-law did so,
and the fool as he sat in the sledge, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the pike&rsquo;s behest, and at my request, set
forward, sledge, to the forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words the sledge forthwith went forth.&nbsp; The
country people living around were quite astounded to see Emelian
riding in the sledge without horses, and going with such speed
that, even if the best pair of horses in the world had been
fastened to the sledge, it would have been impossible to go
quicker.&nbsp; Now as it was necessary for the fool, in order to
reach the forest, to go through the town, he drove through it at
full speed; but as he did not know that it was necessary for him
to cry out, in order that the people might not be run over, he
drove <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>through the city without crying to
the people to get out of the way, and ran over a great number of
them, and although they gave chase to him, yet it was impossible
to overtake him.&nbsp; Emelian, having passed through the city
and reached the wood, stopped the sledge.&nbsp; The fool then
getting out of the sledge, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the pike&rsquo;s behest, and at my request, fall,
hatchet, now to cutting wood; and do you, wood, gather yourself
into the sledge and be corded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely had the fool said these words when the hatchet began
to cut wood, and the wood, gathering itself up, placed itself in
the sledge, and tied itself with the cord.&nbsp; After he had cut
as much wood as he wanted, he ordered the hatchet to cut down a
small oak; and when the hatchet had done so, he placed himself
upon the load, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the pike&rsquo;s behest, and at my request, O
sledge, now travel home.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>The sledge instantly set off very briskly.&nbsp; But
when Emelian arrived at the city in which he had run over so many
people, the folks were waiting for him in order to seize him, and
as soon as he drove into the city they set about dragging him off
the load and began to belabour him.&nbsp; The fool, seeing that
they were pulling him and beating him, said these words, in an
undertone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the pike&rsquo;s behest, and at my request, now,
sapling, break their arms and legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forthwith the sapling, springing out, began to beat them in a
pretty manner, and the people taking to flight, the fool drove
out of the town to his own village, whilst the sapling drubbed
all soundly, and went in pursuit of them.&nbsp; Emelian, on
reaching his home, mounted upon the petsch.</p>
<p>In the meantime, after he had driven out of the city, there
was much talk of him everywhere,&mdash;not because he had driven
over a <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>number of people, but because he had
come driving to the city on a sledge without horses; and by
degrees the news reached the court, and came to the ears of the
king himself.&nbsp; The king, on hearing the story, felt no
little desire to see the fool, and sent an officer with some
soldiers to seek him.&nbsp; The officer proceeded without delay
out of the city, taking the road by which the fool had travelled
in order to go to the forest.&nbsp; On arriving at the village
where Emelian lived, the officer sent for the starost, or head
man of the village, and said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sent by the king to take your fool, and convey him
to his presence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The starost immediately showed him the house where Emelian
lived, and the officer, going into the kitchen,
demanded&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the fool?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fool, who was lying on the petsch, answered&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that to me?&nbsp; Dress yourself quickly
that I may carry you to the presence of the king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quoth Emelian:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have I to do there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer, enraged at his answering so disrespectfully,
struck him on the cheek.&nbsp; The fool, feeling himself struck,
said softly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the pike&rsquo;s behest, and at my request, oak
sapling, break their hands and shins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sapling hopping forth, began to beat them, drubbing them
all preciously, both officer and soldiers, so that the officer
was obliged to return discomfited.&nbsp; Arriving at the city, he
related to the king how the fool had beaten them all.&nbsp; The
king was very much astonished, and did not believe it possible
that he could have beaten so many.&nbsp; The king, however,
selected a prudent man, whom he sent with an <!-- page 23--><a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>injunction to
bring the fool to him if possible, even though he should have
recourse to deceit.&nbsp; The king&rsquo;s envoy, arriving at the
village where Emelian lived, sent for the starost, and said to
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sent by the king to fetch your fool; but first of
all, bring before me the people with whom he lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The starost instantly ran and brought the sisters-in-law; and
the envoy asked them&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does the fool like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sisters-in-law replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious, sir, our fool likes to be intreated to do a
thing; he refuses once and twice in order to be entreated a third
time, when he never refuses, but does all that he is
asked,&mdash;but he does not like to be spoken to
roughly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The envoy then dismissed them, warning them not to tell
Emelian that he had sent for them.&nbsp; After that, having
bought some raisins, <!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>prunes, and dried figs, he proceeded
to the house of the fool, and on his arrival he went up to the
petsch, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s this, Emelian, why are you lying on the
petsch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, giving him the raisins, prunes, and dried figs, he
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Emelian, I will carry you to the king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the fool answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am warm here,&rdquo; for he loved nothing but
warmth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go, Emelian,&rdquo; said the envoy, &ldquo;you
will be quite comfortable there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said the fool, &ldquo;but I am
lazy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the envoy began to beseech him once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray let us go, Emelian, the king has ordered a red
caftan to be made for you, and also a red cap, and red
boots.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>The fool, hearing that a red caftan had been ordered to
be made for him, provided he went, said: &ldquo;Do you go before,
and I will follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The envoy, not wishing to trouble him any more, left him, and
asked privately of the sisters-in-law whether the fool would not
deceive him; but they assured him that he never deceived
anybody.&nbsp; The envoy then set forth on his return, and the
fool, placing himself once more on the petsch, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O how I wish that I had not to go to court, but was
there already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the pike&rsquo;s behest, and at my request, move
straight, O petsch, to the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the walls of the room gave a crack, and the petsch
sallied forth, and when the petsch was clear of the house it
drove along with such rapidity that it was impossible to <!--
page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>overtake it.&nbsp; On the road it overtook the envoy,
and drove in his company to the court.&nbsp; The king, being told
that the fool had arrived, went out to look at him, with all his
ministers, and seeing that Emelian came on the petsch, he was
filled with wonder.&nbsp; As for the fool, he lay still, and said
nothing.&nbsp; After a little time the king asked him why he had
run over so many people when he went to the forest for wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could I help it?&rdquo; said Emelian; &ldquo;why
did they not get out of my way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then, the king&rsquo;s daughter came to a window, and
looked at the fool.&nbsp; Emelian, chancing to turn his eye to
the window from which she was looking, and seeing that she was
very handsome, said in an undertone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the pike&rsquo;s behest, and at my request, may yon
beauty fall in love with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner had he pronounced these words than the daughter of
the king fell in love with <!-- page 27--><a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>him as she
gazed upon him.&nbsp; And the fool, after that, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the pike&rsquo;s behest, and at my request, move
back, petsch, to our own house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The petsch, without a moment&rsquo;s delay, marched out of the
court, drove through the city, and made for home, where, on
arriving, it resumed its former place.</p>
<p>After that Emelian lived for some time quite at his ease; but
the king, in the city, fared very differently, for the princess,
having fallen in love with the fool at the words which he had
uttered, began to beg of her father to give her the fool for a
husband.&nbsp; The king was very much incensed both against her
and the fool, and wished very much to lay violent hands on the
latter, but did not know how.&nbsp; Thereupon the king&rsquo;s
ministers proposed that the officer who had before gone for
Emelian, and had failed to bring him, should be sent again for
him on <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>account of his former failure.&nbsp;
The king, approving of their counsel, summoned the officer to his
presence, and when he appeared before him, the king said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, friend, I sent thee for the fool before: but
thou didst not bring him; now for that offence I will send thee a
second time, and in order that thou mayest bring him without
fail, I tell thee that if thou dost bring him thou shalt be
rewarded, and if thou dost not thou shalt be punished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer, on hearing the words of the king departed without
delay in quest of the fool, and having arrived at the village, he
sent again for the starost, and said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is money for you, buy all that is necessary for a
good dinner to-morrow, invite Emelian, and when he is dining with
you ply him with drink until he falls under the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The starost, knowing that he was sent by the <!-- page 29--><a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>king, did not
dare to disobey him, but purchased all that was necessary, and
invited the fool.&nbsp; Emelian having promised to come, the
officer expected him with great joy; and the fool coming the next
day, they plied him so hard with drink that Emelian lay down and
fell dead asleep.&nbsp; The officer, seeing that he was asleep,
immediately ordered his kabitka to be got ready, and to draw up
to the door, and when it drew up they placed the fool in
it.&nbsp; After that the officer got into the kabitka, and
carried him straight to the court.&nbsp; The ministers forthwith
gave information to the king of the arrival of the officer, and
the king no sooner heard of it than he gave orders for a great
barrel to be well fenced with iron hoops, which was forthwith
done, and the barrel was brought to the king, who, seeing that
all was ready, ordered his daughter and the fool to be placed in
the barrel, and the barrel to be covered with <!-- page 30--><a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>pitch.&nbsp;
No sooner had this been done than he commanded the barrel to be
cast into the sea, and was forthwith obeyed.&nbsp; The king then
returned to his palace, and the barrel, abandoned to its fate,
floated about for some hours.&nbsp; The fool all this time was
asleep; awaking, however, at last, and perceiving that he was in
darkness, he asked of himself&mdash;&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; for
he imagined that he was alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are in a barrel, Emelian,&rdquo; said the princess;
&ldquo;and they have placed me with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who are you?&rdquo; asked the fool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the king&rsquo;s daughter,&rdquo; she replied; and
then she related on what account she had been placed in the
barrel with him.</p>
<p>Thereupon she begged him to deliver himself and her from the
barrel.&nbsp; But the fool made no other reply than&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am warm enough here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray have mercy upon me,&rdquo; said the
princess.&nbsp; <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>&ldquo;Take compassion on my tears,
and deliver me out of this barrel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do no such thing,&rdquo; said Emelian,
&ldquo;I am lazy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The princess began again to beseech him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have mercy upon me, Emelian; save me out of this
barrel, and do not let me die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fool, being moved by her entreaties and tears, said to
her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, I will do this one thing for
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; After that, he said softly to himself:
&ldquo;At the pike&rsquo;s behest, and at my request, cast up, O
sea, this barrel, in which we lie, on some dry place, as near as
possible to our own country; and do thou, barrel on coming to dry
ground, go to pieces of thyself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely had the fool uttered these words when the sea began
to heave, and forthwith cast the barrel on dry ground, whereupon
the barrel went to pieces of itself.&nbsp; Emelian arose, and
<!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>went with the princess farther up the land on which they
were cast, and the fool perceived that they were upon a very
beautiful island, on which were a great number of trees of
different kinds, and with all kinds of fruits; and the princess,
seeing these things, was very much rejoiced that they were upon
so beautiful an island.&nbsp; In a little time, however, she
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Emelian, where are we to live, for here I
don&rsquo;t see a hut or any kind of shelter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the fool said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are already hankering for something
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do be so kind, Emelian, as to order some kind of house
to be built,&rdquo; said the princess, &ldquo;in order that we
may have some place to take shelter in when it rains;&rdquo; for
by this time the princess knew that he could do anything if he
did but please.</p>
<p>But the fool said:</p>
<p><!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>&ldquo;I am lazy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon she began to beseech him again, and Emelian, touched
by her entreaties, was obliged to do what she desired; and going
a little way apart from her, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the pike&rsquo;s behest, and at my request, may
there be erected, in the midst of this island, a palace which
shall be twice better than the king&rsquo;s; and may there be
from the palace a crystal bridge to cross the water by; and may
there be in the palace all kinds of servants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely had he pronounced these words when an enormous palace
with a crystal bridge made its appearance.&nbsp; The fool and the
princess, entering the palace, perceived that there was plenty of
magnificent furniture in the rooms, and that there were numbers
of people, both lackeys and officers, of various descriptions,
who were awaiting the commands of the fool.&nbsp; The fool,
seeing that all these people had a decent <!-- page 34--><a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>and
honourable appearance, and that he alone was a lout, wished to be
made better, and therefore said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the pike&rsquo;s behest, and at my request, be I now
made a youth so handsome as to have no equal, and possest of the
very best of understandings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words were scarcely uttered when he became so handsome
and intelligent that everybody wondered.&nbsp; After this,
Emelian sent one of his servants to the king, to invite him and
all his ministers to the palace.&nbsp; The messenger of Emelian
rode to the king over that same crystal bridge which the fool had
built.&nbsp; On his arrival at court the ministers presented him
to the king, whom the messenger addressed in this manner:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious sir, I am sent by my master with his humble
compliments to invite you to dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is thy master?&rdquo; demanded the king.</p>
<p><!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>But the messenger replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell you, gracious sir, anything of my
master&rdquo; (for the fool had forbidden him to say who he was);
&ldquo;but after you have dined together he will give you a full
account of himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king, filled with curiosity to know who it could be that
invited him to dinner, told the messenger that he would come
without fail; and the messenger forthwith returned.&nbsp;
Scarcely had he arrived when the king, with all his ministers,
came riding over the bridge to dine with the fool.&nbsp; On the
arrival of the king at the palace Emelian went out to meet him,
took him by the hand white as snow, kissed him on the mouth sweet
as sugar, and leading him into his palace of white marble, set
him down to the oaken table to the feast of sweet things and
mead; and the king and his ministers, sitting at the table,
drank, ate, and were merry.&nbsp; Now <!-- page 36--><a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>when they got
up from table, and sat in their places, the fool said to the
king:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious sir; do you know me, and who I am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as Emelian was then in a splendid dress, and moreover as
his face was very handsome, it was impossible to recognise
him.&nbsp; Therefore the king said that he did not know
him.&nbsp; But the fool said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious sir, do you not remember how a certain fool
came driving to your court on a petsch, and how you shut him up
with your daughter in a barrel, which you covered over with
pitch, and cast out upon the sea?&nbsp; Know now that I am that
very same Emelian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king, seeing that it was the fool who was now before him,
was very much frightened, and did not know what to do.&nbsp; But
the fool at that moment went for the princess, and led her before
the king.&nbsp; The king on seeing his <!-- page 37--><a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>daughter was
very much delighted, and said to the fool:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have sinned grievously against you; I therefore give
you my daughter as a wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fool, on hearing these words, most humbly thanked the
king; and as Emelian had everything ready for the marriage, it
was celebrated that day with great magnificence.&nbsp; On the
next day the fool gave a magnificent banquet to all the
ministers, whilst for the common people hogsheads were brought
out, full of all kinds of drinks.&nbsp; When the rejoicing was
over the king offered to resign his kingdom to him, but he
refused to accept it.&nbsp; Thereupon the king returned to his
dominions.&nbsp; But the fool remained in his palace, and lived
in great happiness and prosperity.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
